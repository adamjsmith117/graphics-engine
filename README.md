# graphics-engine

An ongoing personal project exploring the creation of graphics engines with C++ and OpenGL.

## Setup

In order to be able to run this project, some libraries and include files must be obtained and linked in the visual studio solution. This includes GLFW, GLAD, and OpenGL itself. OpenGL has so many different versions and so much variation based on the machines running it that these binaries must be compiled yourself on your machine. [Follow these instructions](https://learnopengl.com/Getting-started/Creating-a-window), it makes it very easy to follow along.
